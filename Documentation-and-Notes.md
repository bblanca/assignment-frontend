# Documentation & Notes

## Time Usage
Time reading documentation & watching tutorials before starting assignment: 3,5h

Time reading documentation & watching tutorials of react-beautiful-dnd and implementing a **working solution** : 2h

Time restructuring, adding reducers, contexts and using a different data structure: 12h (I watched and read a lot of different tutorials to find ways to improve my solution and then I implemented different approaches.)

 

## Remarks
- Naming: The names in the given project was "kanban", "list" and "item". I have adopted this naming, however, I would actually prefer the names "board", "column" and "card", since they are more common (theseare also the names that are used in the readme).

## Further Improvements
 - In my opinion, it would be prettier if the grey list boxes are resized (become smaller) during the DND process, and not only after the item is dropped.

 - The case where an item is added but not immediately named should be handled: I would suggest deleting the item, because if the user does not want to name the item, he probably added it by mistake.

 - For more complex projects, a state management library should be used.
