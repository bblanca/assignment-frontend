# Documentation & Notes

still todo: prettier, 
consistent naming: I before Interfaces  yes or no?
unused stuff, 
serializable


## Time Usage
Time reading documentation & watching tutorials before starting assignment: 3,5h

Time reading documentation & watching tutorials of react-beautiful-dnd and implementing a working solution : 1,5h

Time restructuring, adding reducer, context and using a different data structure: 4h



## Remarks
 - grey list-boxes do not become smaller during the DND process but only after DragEnd
 - if a item is added but it is not named: what should happen? (I would suggest deleting item since creating was probably a mistake )
 - for bigger projects: state management tools?
 - no complex error handling was implemented -> I simply throw an error
 - naming: given naming for kanban was 'list' and 'item' --> however, they are mostly called 'column' and 'card', Board?
 



## Questions

 - IDE, Libraries
